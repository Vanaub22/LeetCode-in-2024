# LeetCoding in 2024

I have been active on LeetCode since January 2023. I have solved **900+ problems** on the platform and I am loving the learning experience so far. I also have a **Leetcode Contest Rating** of **1642 (Top 17.44%)** as of 31st January, 2024.

Link to my [My LeetCode Profile](https://leetcode.com/Anuvab).

This repository is dedicated to store all my LeetCode submissions from **1st January, 2024 onwards**.

I am using the extension [LeetHub v2](https://github.com/arunbhardwaj/LeetHub-2.0) to achieve this.

It will only work when you are submitting your solutions in the old **legacy version** of LeetCode and using **Microsoft Edge Browser**. It won't sync your earlier submissions, it will only keep on adding your new submissions.
